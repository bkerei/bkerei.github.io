                    <h4>
                        <blockquote>"."</blockquote>

                        What is 'scope' and how it works in JavaScript?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Think of scope as headphones. Let's say you have one set of wired headphones and another set
                        are bluetooth.Local scope is the area you can move from your desk with wired headphones, its
                        limited but everything you need is in one place so it's fine. Here is your domain with your
                        Doctor Who stuff and empty coffee mugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Global scope is having bluetooth and walking around outside that area. You can move without the
                        fear of everyone finding out youâ€™re listening to the Hamilton soundtrack when you accidentally
                        pull your headphones out of your computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In JavaScript local scope is when is where things get declared, so lets say I declare my coffee
                        mugs name is Albert, within the confines of my desk he is know as Albert.
                        However outside of my desk zone his name is Roger. So with in desk zone (local scope) he is
                        know as Albert, but outside this he is known as Roger (global).
