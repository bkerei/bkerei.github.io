                                                  They are same thing, to be mindful is to self aware. If you are mindful of your own actions and the affect/effect they have
                                                  then you are self aware.

                                                    I do a body scan meditation twice a day. Through the app Calm you can do guided meditation with a body scan. i find this method is because I hold anger and tension in my hands, it's why I have to keep clicking my little finger on my left hand back into place. 
                                                    My self doubt sits in my shoulders and my anxiety is in my chest, while my emotions are in my stomach, hence why I'm fat. Its the most valuable thing I've learnt 
                                                    and I 100% back this method.

                                                    I’m actually alot more self aware than i thought. I took this journey a few years back and I am very aware of my of my emotional spread and I took steps to get it in line. I also loved the explanation of self confidence, I have a screenshot 
                                                    with a quote from an TV show called Agent Carter that is my mantra <blockquote>”I know my worth and no one else’s opinion of me matters”</blockquote>

                                                 I’m not arogant about who I am or how I betray myself, I just know what I am worth and who I am and 
                                                 I don’t care what other people think of me, at the end of the day the only opinion that matters is me. I am a flawed person who 
                                                 took the hard road more times than they can count but came out better. Everyday I strive to be kinder and wiser to myself and others around me.
