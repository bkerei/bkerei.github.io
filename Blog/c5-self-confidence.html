                        What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        They are same thing, to be mindful is to self aware. If you are mindful of your own actions and
                        the affect/effect they have
                        then you are self aware.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).
                        What was your experience of it? How did you feel?

                        I do a body scan meditation twice a day. Through the app Calm you can do guided meditation with
                        a body scan. i find this method is because I hold anger and tension in my hands, it's why I
                        have to keep clicking my little finger on my left hand back into place.
                        My self doubt sits in my shoulders and my anxiety is in my chest, while my emotions are in my
                        stomach, hence why I'm fat. Its the most valuable thing I've learnt
                        and I 100% back this method.

                    <h4>
                        What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I’m actually alot more self aware than i thought. I took this journey a few years back and I am
                        very aware of my of my emotional spread and I took steps to get it in line. I also loved the
                        explanation of self confidence, I have a screenshot
                        with a quote from an TV show called Agent Carter that is my mantra <blockquote>”I know my worth
                            and no one else’s opinion of me matters”</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not arogant about who I am or how I betray myself, I just know what I am worth and who I am
                        and
                        I don’t care what other people think of me, at the end of the day the only opinion that matters
                        is me. I am a flawed person who
                        took the hard road more times than they can count but came out better. Everyday I strive to be
                        kinder and wiser to myself and others around me.
