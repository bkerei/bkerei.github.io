                        Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did
                        it go?

                        So this hit close to home. I’m in the middle of conflict right now and my issue is how to move
                        past it. I have lost trust and faith in this person to do right by me and I know fear for my
                        job backed of their actions. Through this chapter I can see the steps that need to be taken to
                        move forward however i know that I will be the one making the steps because this other party
                        doesn’t care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving forward I will be using the Loving-Kindness meditation and the skills for dealing with
                        conflict.I need to move forward in order to be in the right headspace for boot camp.

                    <h4>
                        Try empathic listening - how did it go?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I do this for a living and in my personal life. My middle name funnily enough means listen in
                        Maori. It's not hard to listen and listen beyond the words and feel the emotion of what the
                        person is saying. We speaking using not just words but body language and vocal variety which is
                        were you find the emotion. It's the little ups and downs in how we say the words or express a
                        phrase.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
                    </h4>
                    <p>

                        Like shuffling a block from your brain and getting your emotional reactions in order. I also
                        find I smile more at people when I walk down the street.

                    <p>
                        I reacted to some situations in a negative way.Instead of taking the higher ground I reacted
                        with the first thing that popped into my head and the unfiltered frustration offended the other
                        party. When there is no trust in a working relation it can be hard to figure out the intent
                        that the comment is coming from.
                        I was telling Bobbi to do what should have been doing and she reacted in negative and dickish
                        behaviour. Other behaviours like consulting other managers instead of me on situations makes it
                        hard for me to be her manager. She will disregard my management and override my decisions. She
                        does not aks she goes out and does it and then tells em she has done it.
                        Bobbi’s behaviour was uncalled for as she has no or little respect for me as a manager. She
                        doesn’t think before she speaks nor does she filter her replies. Given that I don’t trust her I
                        do not know the intent that it comes from and it feels like a personal attack when spoken to in
                        this way or undermined.

                    <p>
                        Ok this chapter was eye opening because right now I’m stuck in a “how do we move past this?”
                        situation. In this case I have to do the work because the other party has no interest in doing
                        so as they won in their eyes.

                        I believe they went into this situation without realising what the outcome may be. Right now I
                        have to make the best I can do with a manager I do not trust to get through this part so I get
                        to boot camp. I will make the changes I need to make to be able to communicate and move on.

                        I have no control over the other party and what I’ve learnt in this chapter is to remind myself
                        may they be well, may they be happy and may they free from suffering. I mean that
                        wholeheartedly and with sincerity and kindness.
