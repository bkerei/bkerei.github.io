                        To reference my <a href="https://bkerei.github.io/Blog/c2-emotional-intelligence.html">2nd blog</a>
                        I work with some amazing, sweet and compassionate people. This job is the best one I've ever
                        had. I am surround by awesome inspiring, intelligent and kind keaders and co workers.

                        My favourite was a team leader named Tegan. She cared for you and tried her hardess to make
                        your work life better. You coud feel her heart and geniue care and she was honest. I had an
                        intense disagreement with her about a situation, afterwrads I turned to her and said "I'm proud
                        of us for having that conversation and not hating each other afterwards", we laughed and takked
                        abut what we felt and moved on.

                        Nice! its lovely to see the good in people upfront instead of the usual "Foe" view.

                        I do this already. My job is mentally taxing so after a bad call I take in all the negative and
                        then push it out through breath.It hard at first but it gets easier as you do it more and more.

                        Status - by completing and working towards Dev academy I have alot of people telling me they
                        are proud of me and being so helpful. Certainty- I had uncertainty of how I was going to live
                        while studying. This has been cleared up and my leave plus work hours have been sorted so I can
                        still pay rent. Autonomy - I have control over my work and money situation so i'm a lot more
                        relaxed. Relatedness - I do not view anyone in this stage of things as a foe, just people I
                        haven't got to know yet.Fairness - I feel like fairness is a matter of perspective, I am lucky
                        I have access to people with knowledge that some others in my cohort don't so that be seen as
                        unfair.

                        Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to
                        develop!)

                        So that last blog with the whole dealing with conflict. I had that difficult conversation about
                        moving on from that. I believe that conflict is healthy, you confront the issue and then you
                        work through it. I have no issues with doing this I just have to remember write my thoughts
                        down and come from a place of kindness and compassion when I talk. Which I did and we're
                        working through things.
                    </p>

                        I'm just stoked to get started at bootcamp! Bring it!!
