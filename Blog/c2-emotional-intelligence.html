                                        and kindness. (You may want to call your doctor to determine if

                                        This is Jon (aka Jmac) in list form. I've been vey lucky to have been able to
                                        work with this man for the last 6 years and is everything mentioned about what
                                        a person with emotional inteligence is. Even beyond Jon, I work with others who
                                        I can see the
                                        same values in them as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Emotional intelligence is setting your own personal code of conduct. Its how
                                        you choose to interact with the world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I studied psychology at uni plus done a number of courses through work on EI
                                        (emotional intelligence), Courgous converstaions, Resilence etc I know what EI
                                        is and alot of this all comes back to Mindfulness.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A couple of years ago I was having a hard time at work so I decided that i
                                        needed to make changes. Customer Service is hard and you need alot of resilence
                                        to deal with the pure, unadulterated and very raw emotions you get confronted
                                        with via email and
                                        on the phone. This can get to you especially when you don't know what the next
                                        call or next email is going to be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of things I chose to impliment was taking up meditation. What this did was
                                        made me more aware of me and what triggers my negative behaviours and just
                                        overall being more postive to be around. In the last few months I've pushed
                                        that aside to focus on
                                        other things, so making time to just be, hasn't been a priority. What I learnt
                                        from reading this chapter is I need to make make time again and to get my
                                        houses back in order.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By houses I mean my mind, body and wellbeing need a big tidy up, because things
                                        need to be in order for me to be the best version of me.
                                    </p>

                                        Meet Calm, my favourite go to app for guided meditation. I've taken up doing
                                        this 15 mins in the morning when I wake up and 15 mins before bed. Its been a
                                        week and I forgot on Friday night/Saturday morning when I got home (staff
                                        party), but so far feeling
                                        good and more settled so to speak.
