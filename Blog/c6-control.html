                                                    Like I said in my previous blogs I did alot work on myself a couple of years back and I found my two big triggers are not being heard and wasting time. My brain buzzes at 2000 miles an hour sometimes and I can switch topics faster than I can verbalise, so not being given the space to make my point frustrates and angers me. The other is wasting time, I like my feedback and directions direct and straight to the point so I can process the thing and just get onto it. I can be very blunt unintentionally when someone doesn’t get to the point or let em ask the direct questions to get to the point. I’m not a fan of mindless babble and like to get my info and then move on.

                                                    How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
                                                </h4>
                                                <p>
                                                        I work a high stress and sometime mentally draining job. You get confronted on a day n day out unadulterated emotions from rage to joy. The calls that get me are when people don’t get the answers they want to hear and they blame you. Its frustrates me because it's honestly and completely not my fault as I am just the messenger and being made to feel that helpless and in many cases powerless which sets of the “Not being heard or understood” trigger. I used this method this week on the phone and used the mute and volume down buttons liberally. I found my calls improved especially in the frustrating times and the line “They are doing what they think will make them happy” was a revelation. It also help me get perspective on what I am dealing with at the core and helped me remove the emotional impact as well. I became more of nicer person to be around as well, so bonus!
