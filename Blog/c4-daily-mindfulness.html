                        <h4>
                            What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?

                        <p>
                            I use this technique with the members that call me at work, but I've never asked for feedback. I spent a break talking to my 
                            friend Cam. I told him what i was doing and I stood and listened to him and then asked question till I got to the point of his 
                            story. The feedback I got was that I did agood job and I was very calming. I did counceling at Waikato Uni and the active listening stategy is the same and I got a B+ on my assignment for this, and again 
                            I do this for a job so I'm well versed in this technique.

                            Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                          I've incoperated the "Be nice to yourself" and "Send the distractions away with kindness". I'm not keen on the 
                          eye open technique, I like closing my eye when I'm meditating, just makes me feel calmer and more in the right mindset to
                          not think. If that makes sense...
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Any other musings?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                          Meditating Monday to Friday and Mindfully walking on the weekend has been been life changing. If I don't meditate I can feel it 
                          by the way things hit me emotionally during the day. I am calmer. kinder and just easier going and I love it! I also think 
                          I look younger.
