                                                    I use this technique with the members that call me at work, but I've never asked for feedback. I spent a break talking to my 
                                                    friend Cam. I told him what i was doing and I stood and listened to him and then asked question till I got to the point of his 
                                                    story. The feedback I got was that I did agood job and I was very calming. I did counceling at Waikato Uni and the active listening stategy is the same and I got a B+ on my assignment for this, and again 
                                                    I do this for a job so I'm well versed in this technique.

                                                  eye open technique, I like closing my eye when I'm meditating, just makes me feel calmer and more in the right mindset to

                                                  Meditating Monday to Friday and Mindfully walking on the weekend has been been life changing. If I don't meditate I can feel it 
                                                  by the way things hit me emotionally during the day. I am calmer. kinder and just easier going and I love it! I also think I look younger.
