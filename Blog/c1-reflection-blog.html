 <h2>Here I am again, starting another journey in another direction, at what stage can I quote Samuel L Jackson "I'm getting too old for this sh*t?”</h2>

 <h3>So Bobbi, why now? Why EDA?</h3>
 <p>People are inherently good and lovely, however when people are frustrated, proud or just mean it can be hard. Working with customers can be challenging especially in a tech field where you can't see the other person's computer and your demographic is of the least tech savvy type. You become very patient, empathetic and knowledgeable in a variety of topics, after 6 years. So much so it's just known that if it's a thing Bobbi will know or know who to ask.</p>
 <p>It's great that I know most things and people rely on me for my knowledge, but I'm not challenged. A year ago I started asking questions around work and learning what each team does who does what and I found I liked the idea of making things that improve a members experience of our site. Given that for 6 years I'd heard every gripe you can think of I really wanted to explore how I could help make our site better for our members. By doing so freeing up CS to do more good in other places and/or other ways. </p>
 <p>So, why EDA? I was learning through Code Academy and a lovely Dev I work with had set me up with Dev stuff, which was great but I wanted more. It's all good and well learning the code and making things, but there is more to being a Dev than that, you have to work within a team in a collaborative and healthy way. While I have no doubt in my ability to learn the work, I wanted to make sure that I had all the skills to be a great, well rounded Dev. I've had friends and workmates go through EDA and I knew that this was the type of learning environment was were I wanted to be.</p>
 <h3>What are my impressions so far?</h3> 
 <p>Good! I enjoy the challenge of getting to know GitHub and working out ways to fit things into my life which is now more full on that it has been in years, but it's a good full on. I can feel my brain working for the first time in years, not just because of the technical aspects but the reflection side of things. </p>
 <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> bought up some very interesting concepts that were big light bulb moments, one was the Restaurant/Kitchen thinking. As a daughter/granddaughter/niece of teachers and a self motivated person I believe that you only benefit from an educational opportunity according to how much effort you put in. I've always seen education as a kitchen because you have to put the effort in to make things happen for you as well as supporting the other around you to fill in the gaps of knowledge to make a great carrot cake. </p>
 <p>As a Maori woman you spend alot of time in kitchens cooking, so if your helping means peeling potatoes, then you peel the potatoes. You are working towards the same greater good.</p>
 <h3>How do I see myself engaging with the culture?</h3> 
 <p>I work for a company that is big on culture, we have similar principles but with different names but they are the same as the 3 pillars. Coming from an Awhi environment to another Awhi environment with a similar culture will be an easy transition.</p> 
 <h3>What are my expectations of EDA?</h3> 
 <p>Something Shereef mentioned was being a "World Class Beginner", which is a frightening concept and an exciting one at the same time. My expectations for EDA is just that, to help me learn skills that will help me be a "World Class Beginner". To encourage knowledge that will make adatable for any position within the IT field. Is that a lot to ask for? I don't think it is when combined with the right effort.</p>
 <h3>Am I excited to participate in this learning environment? Does it make me nervous?</h3> 
 <p>To be honest, I haven't actually thought about it. At this moment I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to live during Bootcamp. How many hours can I lose so I can give Bootcamp my all, but can still pay my bills, rent and eat? I got food poisoning on Thursday and I had to take Friday off and all I could think while my head was down the toilet was 'That's one lot of 8 hours of my annual I couldn't afford to lose because you used all your sick leave when you had surgery back in Jan". I know will happen is once I start and I've built up that leave again by working extra hours it will remove a lot of that anxiety. It just getting there.</p>
 <p>It’ll work out, I know it will and this anxiety will pass. It's not gonna be an easy road but it’ll be worth it :)</p>
