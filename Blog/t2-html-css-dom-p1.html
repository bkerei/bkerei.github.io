          <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
          <p>
              <blockquote>You have a phone line right? Well your browser is the phone you plug in. Its how you use the internet to do things. When you open your browser you view the internet.
            Now in order to see things you have to create pictures and text for you to look at, these are called sites. To make a page you follow a resccipe like a cake. 
            Think of HTML like cake battter, its the core basis of a cake. Without cake batter you can't have cake, well you can't have a site without HTML. 
            CSS is the icing or sprinkle you put oon the cake to make it look pretty. When you go to a site and it has bold writing or pretty pictures this is CSS.
            DOM is what the site sits on. When mixing the batter its the bowl, when baking its the cake tin and when you take it out to be decorated its the plate or lazy susan.</blockquote>

           This is what I do for a living. I break down IT terms or processes into easy to understandable format for people who may not be too tech savvy.

         <h4> What is meant by boxifying design?</h4> 
         <p><img src="images/boxify1.jpg" alt="boxify1.jpg"></p>
         <p>
           Essentially its the fact that the internet is made of boxes, even the circles are boxes. My dad was a typesetter for the local newspaper, his job was to put things in the right place on a newspaper page.
           Same thing, all newspaper pages are split into columns and within those columns you place your boxes or in the case of a paper, your articles and advertising.
           A site is the same thing, your oranising your links, pictures, text within the same basic layout.
           Well this is how I see it, or I've been able to explin the process to myself.
         </p>
         <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
         <p><img src="images/boxify2.jpg" alt="boxify2.jpg"></p>
         <p> 
          It's that...Like yeah. Oh yeah I have to explain right?
         </p>
         <p> 
           Its the biger box that wraps around your HTML code like a blanket and it how you get the boxes, spaces from the edge and margins.
           It basically dictates were your stuff will all sit on your site. So boxifying design is what the process is called when you have boxes 
           when you look at a site, while the box model is what does the thing to make it look boxy (box like not the Youtuber).
