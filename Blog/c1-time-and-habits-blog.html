          <h4>In the words of Bowie <blockquote>"Time may change me but I can't change time"</blockquote>
          </h4>
            <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
            <p>I tried the Timebox/Pomodoro mix up because I like the tomatoes and it looked interesting. I started
              with this blog and made sure I had a timer set to go off every 25 mins, then I'd set a timer for 5 mins
              where I picked up my crocheting for 5 mins. My objective was to get my blog sorted for the sprint and
              then create my CSS sheet. Finally get it all pushed to GitHub.It took a about 5 Pomodoros to achieve
              this.</p>
            <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
            <p>I got alot of crocheting done and my scarf is coming along nicely.</p>
            <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
            <p>My time management has never been an issue, if something needs to be done I make time for it. Right now
              I've made changes to my work and home enviroment to make sure I have time for this. I also have flow down
              naturally. I can focus on a task really well thanks to doing mindnumbing tasks at work for hours on end
              for years. I've managed to master the flow very well. </p>
            <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
            <p>I'll probaly stick with the 25 on 5 off method as its nice to break things up from time to time. Beyond
              that I use mindfulness in my daily life already and I realised I'd slipped a bit lately so I'm gonna work
              on getting back into that and loft thinking.</p>
