                        How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?

                    <p>
                        To be fair, right now, not great. My passion gets me into trouble and I have no pleasure in my
                        career.
                        I have just finished a long planning obligation and I'm just tired to my core. Outside of this
                        my purpose is to get to BootCamp
                        and be in the thick of becoming who I want to be moving forward. My passion and pleasure and
                        purpose feel like they are on hold.
                    </p>
                    <h4>

                        What are your core values?

                    <p>
                        I did this exercise funnily enough this time last year. At the time it was too be supportive of
                        myself and others, to be kind and to be open
                        to change. Revisting this I found that I felt the same but also more optimistic. My core values
                        are"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be kind and practice kindness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be open to changes, different ideals and different opinions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To share knowledge with others to help for the greater good.

                    <p>
                        To leave a legacy of kindeness and warmth after I've gone.

                        Kindness. To be kind to others and myself and make improvements that make technology/life
                        kinder.

                    <p>
                        Excellent! I'm going through something unpleasant at the moment and the resilence exercises
                        have helped with the rage breathing that satrts and helps
                        me get my head in order so I can speak. Meditation has been my saving grace and its been super
                        helpful
                    </p>

                        I do feel more motivated to get things done, thank you for this chapter!
