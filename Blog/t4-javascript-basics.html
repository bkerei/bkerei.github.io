                        So I said "MotherF**ker" alot during this...

                    <h4>
                        How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        You know when start going to the gym and in the begining its hard, but eventually you get fit
                        and it gets easier. Well this is HTML & CSS. JavaScript
                        is the increase in reps and more weight you add to take your training to the next level. When
                        you do this it leaves you sore, tired and frustrated in the begining
                        but eventually you get fitter and it becomes easier. Right now I'm at the lying on the floor
                        covered in anti-flamme and heat bags wishing my body would stop hurting stage.
                        This will pass the more I do it but right now it been emotional.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking
                        up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        When you write code it goes top down so if I wanted to make a code that told me what time of
                        the day I should eat lunch, I would tell it the time
                        it needs to know when lunch is and what the next action is, which would be scream "EAT
                        SOMETHING NOW" through my computer. I would then need to
                        set it up so it knows what the time is now so it can check periodially to make sure it sceams
                        at me at the right time. So the code goes "Do I scream now"
                        it checks the present time and sees its not 12pm yet, then circles back to do the same loop say
                        every 30 mins till it does get to 12pm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would liken this to my alarm going of at 5.30am so I can meditate for 15 mins eveery morning
                        Monday - Friday.
                        Its loop aka action repeated frequently at the same time very work day.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Ok this is gonna be a short one. Objects list objects as a linear line thing, while Arrays let
                        you list things in a pretty
                        ordered way.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I can't do the thing unless I tell javascript what teh tthing is and its function. For example,
                        is it a Varible? Then you tell JS that it is
                        giving it the function "var". Its like telling the checkout operator how you're going to pay
                        for your groceries, they can't serve the next person
                        until you pay, so you have to tell the server how you're going to pay and then complete the
                        purchase. Once you're done you can runaway into the night
                        with your bottle of red and 3 blocks of chocolate without judgement.
