Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world.

                        <h4>
                            What was the problem?
                        </h4>
                        <p> 
                           Firstly, simple is an opinion, what may seem simple to you may be complicated AF to me, so lets change the dialogue from "Problem" to "Knowledge gap". 
                           So <blockquote> When was the last time I had a gap in knowledge when faced with a task?</blockquote> In this sprint I had accidentally pull teh wrong repo 
                           to the wrong folder on my computer which lead to many conflicts and code trying to be something else.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                             What problem solving techniques did you use?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                           In the wise teachings of my mentor/friend George I followed the steps he taught me about what was a merge conflict and how to resolve it. 
                           I then pulled the right repo which sorted the issue out and then pushed it back to GitHub.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                             How did you feel throughout the process?
                        </h4>
                            <p>
                                Freaked out and panicked for a bit and messaged George. Then I took a breath and looked at the issue again and worked through the steps 
                                one at a time till I sorted it. I then messaged George back to say don't worry I fixed it and thank you, his reply was "Lol".
                            </p>
                            <h4>

                            </h4>
                            <p>
                               I amuse George with my semi panic attacks, but also I need to breath and look at the issue again and trust 
                               my own knowledge. I know things now, I can actually do things without guidance and I need to trust in that. 
                            </p>
