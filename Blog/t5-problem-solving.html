                            mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing
                            yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done
                            before,
                            and more importantly, you're doing something.”</blockquote>

                    <h4>
                        Ok that was easier than before and I'm a tad concerned...
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Got blocked on a simple problem?</li>
                            <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        What was the problem?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, simple is an opinion, what may seem simple to you may be complicated AF to me, so lets
                        change the dialogue from "Problem" to "Knowledge gap".
                        So <blockquote> When was the last time I had a gap in knowledge when faced with a task?</blockquote>
                        In this sprint I had accidentally pull teh wrong repo
                        to the wrong folder on my computer which lead to many conflicts and code trying to be something
                        else.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What problem solving techniques did you use?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In the wise teachings of my mentor/friend George I followed the steps he taught me about what
                        was a merge conflict and how to resolve it.
                        I then pulled the right repo which sorted the issue out and then pushed it back to GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How did you feel throughout the process?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Freaked out and panicked for a bit and messaged George. Then I took a breath and looked at the
                        issue again and worked through the steps
                        one at a time till I sorted it. I then messaged George back to say don't worry I fixed it and
                        thank you, his reply was "Lol".
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What did you learn?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I amuse George with my semi panic attacks, but also I need to breath and look at the issue
                        again and trust
                        my own knowledge. I know things now, I can actually do things without guidance and I need to
                        trust in that.
                    </p>
