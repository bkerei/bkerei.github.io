                        I took up mindful mediation 2 years ago when I was in a dark place mentally. Its true it
                        brought a mentally clarity, calmness and happiness. In the last 8 months I had a cruve ball
                        thrown at me and I've just come back to meditaing again in the last 2
                        weeks. I do two guided meditations, 15 mins each twice a day.

                    <p>
                        I need to reincoperate this back into my life on a regular basis! I've been sicker than sick
                        this year so if I can add anything to reduce that I will lovingly do it!! But more than that, I
                        was mediating to clear my mind, I will now make the practice more
                        mindful, and kinder to myself which I is what I was lacking and I will also blu tack this to my
                        computer at work.

                        <blockquote>Sogyal Rinpoche, a world-renowned Tibetan Buddhist teacher, suggests a fun and
                            useful way to find your own posture. He recommends sitting like a majestic mountain. The
                            idea is to think of your favorite
                            mountain, say Mount Fuji or Mount Kilimanjaro, and then pretend to be that mountain when
                            you sit. And there you are, Mister (or Miss) Mount Fuji, majestic, dignified, and awe
                            inspiring. The nice
                            thing is if you sit in a way that you feel majestic, dignified, and awe inspiring, it may
                            also be the same posture that helps you become alert and relaxed, and it is kind of fun.
                            Try this out and
                            see if it works for you.</blockquote>

                        How to appeal to me in a nerdy way, give me quotes and references to studies and will find them
                        and read them. I like lab reports and research, they make a part of me happy. I really enjoyed
                        this chapter!!
