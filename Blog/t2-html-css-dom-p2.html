                <div class="content">
                    <h4>
                        <blockquote>In every job that has to be done is an element of fun!</blockquote>
                    </h4>

                    <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
                    <p><img src="../images/grid1.jpg" alt="boxify2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>
                        When I think about this all I hear is "This is Spinal Tap" in my head
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>I heard you like boxes, so we put boxes inside boxes!</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a site is not boxy enough you put more boxes in those boxes and you have a grid. With this
                        grid system you can place your boxes within the boxes to make certain look.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The best way to answer this is to look at the two versions of Trade Me. <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz">This</a>
                        is the Desktop site and <a href="https://preview.trademe.co.nz/">this</a> is the Preview
                        site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The desktop site looks tiny on a moobile screen, while the Preview version moves and adapts to
                        the persons screen. As more and more people use mobile devices to view the internet sites need
                        to change to be viewable on a smaller screen. Responsiveness
                        is how yoou do this.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Its giving the thing a name. The video on Udacity explains it as a heading, so you're naming
                        the the thing and giving it an istruction using Semantic Tags.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h4>
                    <p>
                        CSS Code is very logical. You tell it to do the thing and it does it. If you want to add
                        something you need to tell it the path it has to take to get there. I like that! Also being
                        responsive is so important now and having a site that can't adapt will
                        lose you business.
