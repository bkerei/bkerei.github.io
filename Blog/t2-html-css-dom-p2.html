         <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
         <p><img src="images/grid1.jpg" alt="boxify2.jpg"></p>
         <p>
           When I think about this all I hear is "This is Spinal Tap" in my head <blockquote>I heard you like boxes, so we put boxes inside boxes!</blockquote>.
           If a site is not boxy enough you put more boxes in those boxes and you have a grid. With this grid system you can place your boxes within the boxes to make 
           certain look.   
         </p>
         <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4> 
         <p>
          The best way to answer this is to look at the two versions of Trade Me. <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz">This</a> is the Desktop site and <a href="https://preview.trademe.co.nz/">this</a> is the Preview site.
         </p>
         <p>
          The desktop site looks tiny on a moobile screen, while the Preview version moves and adapts to the persons screen. As more and more people use mobile devices
          to view the internet sites need to change to be viewable on a smaller screen. Responsiveness is how yoou do this.
         </p>
         <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4> 
         <p>
          Its giving the thing a name. The video on Udacity explains it as a heading, so you're naming the the thing and giving it an istruction
          using Semantic Tags.
         </p> 
         <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h4> 
         <p>
          CSS Code is very logical. You tell it to do the thing and it does it. If you want to add something you need to tell it the path it has
          to take to get there. I like that! Also being responsive is so important now and having a site that can't adapt will lose you business.
