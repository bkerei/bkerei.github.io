         <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
         <p><img src="images/grid1.jpg" alt="boxify2.jpg"></p>
         <p>
           When I think about this all I hear is "This is Spinal Tap" in my head <blockquote>I heard you like boxes, so we put boxes inside boxes!</blockquote>.
           If a site is not boxy enough you put more boxes in those boxes and you have a grid. With this grid system you can place your boxes within the boxes to make 
           certain look.

         <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4> 
         <p>
          The best way to anser this is to look at the wto versions of Trade Me. <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz">This</a> is the Desktop site and <a href="https://preview.trademe.co.nz/">this</a> is the Preview site.
         </p>
         <p>
          The desktop site looks tiny on a moobile screen, while the Preview version moves and adapts to the persons screen. As more and more people use mobile devices
          to view the internet sites need to change to be viewable on a smaller screen. Responsiveness is how yoou do this.
