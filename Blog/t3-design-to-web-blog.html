                    <h4>
                        So I pulled my blog apart and put it back together....
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        You know how you can make a website really tiny to a point and the screen moves around to fit
                        the
                        resized screen? That's a responsive website design. Why is this cool? Because you can see it
                        well on your phone whiel you're on the train.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why is it important? Becasue more and more people are using mobiles to access the internet
                        making it so they can see your site means people will go visit it and use it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What mobile first design is, and why it's important.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Basically mobile first design is all in the name, it about creating a site or internet thingy
                        with a mobile (phone, tablet, iPad) in mind.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What frameworks are there and their pros and cons.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <h3>
                            Responsive web design
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            So again, you know how you can make a website really tiny to a point and the screen moves
                            around to fit the resized screen? That's a responsive website design. Pros are user
                            experience friendly, you save cost on responsive web design development and its
                            search engine optimization friendly so people can find it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cons include, bad compatibility for the old version of IE browser, please note if you are
                            using or someone you love is still using Internet Exployer, for the love of all taht is
                            holy please get onto Chrome! IE doesn't support Javascript its an easy to
                            compromise browser please stop using it. It can aslo take some time to load because its a
                            bit bigger than a normal site and making a reposive site can be a bit of a time suck to
                            make.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Progressive inhancement & Graceful Degradation
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Big words I get it but easy concepts. <b>Progressive inhancement</b> is basically Lite
                            version of Facebook messenger or any lite app really. Its built specifically for the lower
                            tech browser on a phone. While <b>Graceful Degradation</b> is I built
                            and made a kick ass site and then changed at to be mobile friendly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mobile first is starting on your phone and building things and then making a site.
                            Traditionally you go site first and then mobile. Mobile first is the other way around.
                            Simple as that!
                        </p>
                        Cons of <b>Progressive Inhancement</b> are they aren't supported by all browsers and nor by all
                        devices which is a biggy right there. You can't use a framework if its not supported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cons of <b>Graceful Degradation</b> is essentially making the square block fit in the circle
                        shape hole. Much like the puzzle as a kid it can be a time suck and require alot of maintence
                        to keep up with what the mobile platform is doing.
                    </p>

                        What a wireframe is and why we use it.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Here are my wireframes of my previous site before I redesigned it. Its basically the dev
                        version of a mock up. You draw what you want to make so you ahve goal and a visual
                        representation of what you're coding.

                    <h4>
                        The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.

                    <p>
                        It was getting teh boxes in the right place and putting things in the middle and looking
                        centred. As you can see I gave up after awhile. The more I practice doing this the better I'll
                        get at it.
