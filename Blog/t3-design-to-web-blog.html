                        <h4>
                             So I pulled my blog apart and put it back together....
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>
                                What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.
                        </h4>
                        <p> 
                                You know how you can make a website really tiny to a point and the screen moves around to fit the 
                                resized screen? That's a responsive website design. Boom!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why is it important? Becasue more and more people are using mobiles to access the internet
                            making it so they can see your site means people will go visit it and use it.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                                What mobile first design is, and why it's important.
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                                Basically mobile first design is all in the name, it about creating a site or internet thingy
                                with a mobile (phone, tablet, iPad) in mind. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                                What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                                <h3> 
                                        Responsive web design  
                                   </h3>
                                   <p>
                                       So again, you know how you can make a website really tiny to a point and the screen moves around to fit the 
                                       resized screen? That's a responsive website design. Pros are with a few lines of code you can mistakes
                                       an establishesd site responsive.
                                   </p>
                                   <h3>
                                   Progressive Advancement  & Graceful Degradation
                                   </h3>
                                   <p>
                                     Big words I get it but easy concepts. <b>Progressive Advancement</b> is basically Lite version of 
                                     Facebook messenger or any lite app really. Its built specifically for the lower tech browser 
                                     on a phone.  While <b>Graceful Degradation</b> is I built and made a kick ass site and then changed 
                                     at to be mobile friendly.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                     Mobile first is starting on your phone and building things and then making a site. Traditionally you go site first and then mobile. Mobile first is the other way around. Simple as that!
                                   </p>
                        </p>

                                What a wireframe is and why we use it.
